## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I am a Senior Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience building scalable, secure, and event-driven systems. My work focuses on fintech, crypto trading, compliance systems, and internal platforms that operate under real-world constraints such as high throughput, regulatory requirements, and operational reliability.

I enjoy working close to the system internals — designing architectures, building performant services, and turning complex business and regulatory requirements into maintainable software.
